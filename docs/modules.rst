Modules
=======

This application software is divided into two modules. The first one is called
``jelinekstat.py`` and is the guideline of the second-order tensors statistical
proposal of `Jel√≠nek (1978) <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01613632>`_. The second
module is called ``tools.py``, and contains extra supportive tools for the
functions contained in the first module and that are not included implicitly in
the original reference.
