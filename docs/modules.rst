Modules
=======

This application software is divided into two modules. The first one is called
``jelinekstat.py`` and is the guideline of the second-order tensors statistical
proposal of :cite:`Jelinek1978.article`. The second module is called
``tools.py``, and contains extra supportive tools for the functions contained
in the frist module and that are not included implicitly in the original
reference.
