``jelinekstat``: Jelinek's Statistics for Second-Order Tensors
==============================================================

Application software in **Python 3**  to apply the statistical model for a
sample of :math:`n` :math:`2^\mathrm{nd}`-order tensors
`Jelínek (1978) <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01613632>`_ in order to obtain the
mean tensor :math:`\boldsymbol{k}` of the sample, the :math:`\boldsymbol{k}`'s
principal values :math:`k_1, k_2, k_3`, with their confidence intervals, and the
:math:`\boldsymbol{k}`'s principal directions
:math:`\boldsymbol{p}_1, \boldsymbol{p}_2, \boldsymbol{p}_3` with their
confidence regions.

This application program is able to plot the summary of the statistical model
described above in a stereographic projection for a better understanding of the
outcomes.
